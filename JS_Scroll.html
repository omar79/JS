	<!-- 	2) There is a bug where the space in the words do not appear correctly. For example for the word "being helpful" when it shows "being " after showing "being" the space should make the right border/cursor move a little bit to the right (to account for the space being entered by the user) yet it doesn't work correctly. Please fix this error.
	// Hint: You may want to use the code below to represent space
	// DON'T FORGET TO ADD "&" SYMBOL BEFORE IT
	nbsp;
  
	3) The current code is creating lots of global variables; we don' t like this. Use what you learned about immediate functions to wrap all of this code in a single immediate function so that you don't introduce any global variables. Once done, push this to your github and show friends! Check whether the variables created (e.g. el, word_counter, etc) are not defined. Try to console.log these variables outside your immediate function).

	 - ( function() { //code } ) ();
	 - 	You could also pass arguments to an immediate function by doing something like: ( function(arg1, arg2) { 	//code } ) (anArg, anotherArg);

	5) Put this on your GitHub; also upload a simple txt file with a link to your GitHub project for us to review -->
